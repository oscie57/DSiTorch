# DSiTorch

DSi Homebrew Application for enabling the torch on the back of the system.

Currently, only the devKitPro's NDS example is set up.

## Concept

How the application will hopefully work is have information on the top screen, with the bottom screen having a button that will toggle the torch, with it being white and having black text saying "On" when on and black with white text saying "Off".
